the PATH456 environment variable, and can execute programs when given an
absolute or relative path. The ``|``, ``<``, and ``>`` characters should only be
used specify one of the following: a pipe (``|``), redirect output (``>``),
redirect output for appending (``>>``), and to redirect input (``<``). The ``cd``,
``exit``, and ``logout`` commands are built-in.
